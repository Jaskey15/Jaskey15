# Jacob Askey

Bio eng grad turned Peace Corps volunteer turned software builder. Three years of living and working across New Zealand, the Philippines, and Patagonia taught me to approach every problem with a beginner's mind. Now I'm back at a keyboard, focused on the intersection of AI and automation — building tools that change how people interact with technology, not just digitize the old way of doing things.

Currently running [Workspring](https://www.workspring.io) and volunteering as a Data Engineer at the Oklahoma Conservation Commission.
