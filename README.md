# Jacob Askey

Biological engineer turned Peace Corps volunteer turned software builder. Three years of living and working across New Zealand, the Philippines, and Patagonia taught me to approach every problem with a beginner's mind. Now I'm back at a keyboard, building systems that act on your behalf rather than just responding to commands.

Currently running [Workspring](https://www.workspring.io) and volunteering as a Data Engineer at the Oklahoma Conservation Commission.
