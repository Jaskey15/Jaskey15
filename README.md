I was never a fan of the deferred life plan. At the age of 25, I decided to quit my stable civil engineering job to explore parts unknown.

From working on a farm in New Zealand, to a government office in the Philippines, to climbing sheer cliffs in Patagonia, my life looked a bit different than what I knew before. The most important lesson I learned along the way is to approach every situation with a beginner's mind. Staying open, curious, and ready to learn.

Three years later, my focus has shifted back towards building capital. My current obsession is all things software and artificial intelligence. We're at an inflection point that will reward those willing to re-think how humans interact with technology.

Currently providing AI and automation support for small businesses as the founder of Workspring. If you're building at the edge of what's possible, I'd love to connect and hear what you're working on.
