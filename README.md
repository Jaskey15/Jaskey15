## Hi there 👋

Environmental data holds untapped potential to solve our planet's biggest challenges. Remote sensing technologies have drastically enhanced our ability to understand the natural world, but the real breakthroughs happen when we can identify patterns and scale solutions globally.

After two and a half years in engineering consulting, I grew frustrated with a corporate model driven by short-term economics rather than meaningful impact. I decided take time off to travel and learn about sustainability principles firsthand. I worked with regenerative agriculture and bioconstruction practitioners across South America and New Zealand. 

When I later dove into the world computer science, everything clicked. I realized the biggest impact wouldn't come from individual projects alone. Programming wasn't just another tool - it was the key to amplifying environmental impact at scale.

My first project combined my environmental expertise with Python to create a dashboard that makes 20+ years of stream health data accessible to everyone. Next, I'm taking these skills to the Philippines to tackle water scarcity challenges that could inform solutions globally.
