# Jacob Askey

Biosystems engineer turned software builder. 

Three years of living and working across New Zealand, the Philippines, and South America taught me to approach every problem with a beginner's mind. Now I'm back at a keyboard, applying that mindset software. The latest advancements in artificial intelligence present an opportunity to re-think how humans interact with technology.

Currently running [Workspring](https://www.workspring.io) and volunteering as a Data Engineer at the Oklahoma Conservation Commission.
